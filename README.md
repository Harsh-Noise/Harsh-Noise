Hello,

I'm Harsh-Noise, a chemistry student with an interest in computer science.

I mostly code small projects in Java, but I know Python as well. May expand into Rust for faster algorithms.

I'll be uploading what I make for others to learn from, or maybe even give me tips on how to better myself.
